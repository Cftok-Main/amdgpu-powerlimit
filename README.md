# amdgpu-powerlimit

From Claymores Dual Miner in hope it will never lost

Run from Terminal with:
bash set_amd_gpu_power_limit.sh 0 150

Where 0 is the number of Graphiccard / GPU, If you have 3 Cards, they have numbers 0, 1, 2.

150 is the amount of powerconsumption you allow the card. 150 watts in this example. Fine for a Radeon VII.
